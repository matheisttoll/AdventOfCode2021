;; For the y position we assume that the target is below the submarine.
;; Since the story implies it and it is true for my input it should be fine.
;; The possible situations are a bit different for y since it will not stop
;; completely

;; x-steps does not seem to matter (at leat for my input) since the probe can
;; be shot in way that it remains in the x-target area.
;; For the y-target observe the following:
;; The probe will always reach level 0 again after being shot up, however
;; in the next step it will move down one more than the speed it was shot up.
;; Therefore the highest y-velocity at launch is simply:
;; (1- (abs [lower y-bound of target array]))
